##3D Part Models##
Projects like this require user customization for each individual projector used, so there is no set list of parts needed.  Moreover, my part designs were amateurish 'make-do' designs which could certainly be improved upon, and I was learning openSCAD as I went, so the code could probably be better as well.

That said, I've inclded my [openSCAD](http://openscad.org) models here as a jumping-off point for other makers.  Please let me know if you improve upon these, in particular if you design a part that fits a common projector.

For those unfamiliar with openSCAD, it allows for a programmatic description of parts.  I exported these models to STL files for use with my 3d printer.

Included here are several camera mounts - some of which have several pieces - and a lamp mount.  Camera mount is without question the weakest spot of my design, and I'm actively seeking improved camera mount designs that make focus and positioning easier.
